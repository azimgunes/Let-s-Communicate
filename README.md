# **Let's Communicate**

The role of communication in our lives is indisputable; in the 21st century, communication has become easier and faster compared to previous centuries. One of the significant aspects of the rapid communication revolution is messaging applications. In our application, software components are separated using the MVVM architecture. On the service side, Firebase, owned by Google, is utilized. The SDWebImage library is also used to fetch data from the server and display it to the user effortlessly. Thus, the basic requirements for communication, which are the fundamental purpose of our application, have been fulfilled, and a large part of the project has been successfully implemented towards its goal.
